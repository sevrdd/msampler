# msampler

This is open source so do whatever you want with it but please don't use it in a negative way.
At first i made this because of how bad and clunky websites recently became at downloading things off the internet.
I kept it very barebones to keep it fast, so no gui.
I made another version (m4a_fix) for those who cannot use m4a files in their daws. (This fix only works for youtube downloads)
It uses yt_dlp for the standard version, and a combination of yt_dlp and pytube for the m4a_fix version for those who are interested.
I'm pretty new at coding so any constructive criticism is welcomed!
If you have any issues or questions running it just send me a message (preferably discord) and i'll answer you as fast as possible! 


Set up
-
- I recommend pinning or making a shortcut of the exe somewhere that you can quicly access (i personally have it pinned to the start menu)
- I recommend doing the same thing for the msampler_output folder which is where all your downloads go.
